                    I draw it and after that I go in the kitchen and cook it.
                    This is the process of every single recipe from the menu.” ̴̴  Chef Joseph Hadad

                <p>Contemporary fine dining, intimate space, author recipes and an art deco style. These are the 4 elements that
                    define Joseph restaurant.
                    With over 40 years of culinary legacy, Chef Joseph Hadad describes himself as a “forever passionate food lover”,
                    driven every day by the same curiosity as that of a child. With the talent of an artist and the determination of
                    an excellent sportsman, Chef Joseph recreates the art of fine dining by combining natural ingredients with culinary
                    architecture, adding a personal touch and so much attention to details.

                concept born from my biggest desire, that of <span class="bold">sharing my dreams with my guests</span>. Whoever walks in my restaurant will not only taste <span class="bold">unique combinations</span> 
                of ingredients, but will also indulge his senses with a <span class="bold">multicultural variety of flavors</span>, brought from all over the world and masterly combined with pure
